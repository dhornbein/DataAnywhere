DataAnywhere
============

The Data Aywhere project seeks to provide a solution for hosting and sharing data sets.

Read more about it in [this blog post](http://blog.dhornbein.com/2013/03/07/data-anywhere-distributed-data-storage-and-sharing-solution/) or on our [github page](http://dhornbein.github.com/DataAnywhere/)

This repo contains two examples, `/weather/` serves weather data through a Python+Flask API while `/occupysandy/` is the code base running an example server that provides access to canvasing data from Staten Island.
