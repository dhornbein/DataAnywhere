NOTES and CONVENTIONS for COLUMN HEADERS for use in LEGEND
1. All lc, even abbrevations (e.g. FEMA)
2. No spaces, use dashes
3. Column name convention is VERB + (NOUN + ADJ?)+ with most general noun first then less specific nouns
4. Naming convention allows, e.g, decorator that retrives all need fields, and then can refine from general to specific
5. Exception to #3: initial 'note' is a prose note field. Note is first so as not to clutter retriveval as in rule #4.
6. Exception to #3: initial 'project' is a column header that can only be fully understood by consulting subject matter expert from projects
7. Implied subject of all #3 sentences is the contact, e.g. have-electricity means The contact being interviewed has electricity.
8. All have and need columns have Boolean values. All past tense verbs (registered) have Boolean values.
